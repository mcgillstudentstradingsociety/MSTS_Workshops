# workshops

Hello MSTS memebers and McGill community!

We have created this repository in ordert to share the workbooks that have been covered in the workshops over the course of the year.
These workbooks will most often tak ethe form of a jupyter notebook. If you have not already, make sure to download Anaconda in order to access
jupyter notebooks. 

We hope you enjoy the content provided in these files!
